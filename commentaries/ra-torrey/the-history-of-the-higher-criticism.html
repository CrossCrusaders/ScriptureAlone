            <h1>R.A. Torrey</h1>
            <p>In the early 1900s many Christians found themselves fighting against the liberalism that was creeping into the church. This gave them a desire to set forth the fundamentals of the Christian faith. The task to compile such works defending the Scriptures was given first to A. C. Dixon, then to Louis Meyer, and then ultimately to R. A. Torrey (1856-1928). They compiled the works of many conservative writers and issued them in twelve volumes (later printed in a four-volume set). Included in their work are articles dealing with the fallacies of higher criticism, the inspiration and unity of Scripture, the archeological attestation of Scripture, the divinity of Christ and the Holy Spirit, justification by faith, personal testimonies and much more. This work became known as The Fundamentals. The importance of The Fundamentals was that it showed that there are very reasonable defenses to answer claims against Scripture. This is the unabridged edition which features ninety different articles by sixty-six authors.</p>

                    <i>What is the meaning of the Higher Criticism? Why is it called higher? Higher than what?</i>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    At the outset it must be explained that the word "Higher" is an academic term, used in this connection in a purely special or technical sense. It is not used in the popular sense of the word at all, and may convey a wrong impression to the ordinary man. Nor is it meant to convey the idea of superiority. It is simply a term of contrast. It is used in contrast to the phrase, "Lower Criticism."
                    <br />
                    <br />                    
                    One of the most important branches of theology is called the science of Biblical criticism, which has for its object the study of the history and contents, and origins and purposes, of the various books of the Bible. In the early stages of the science Biblical criticism was devoted to two great branches, the Lower, and the Higher. The Lower Criticism was employed to designate the study of the text of the Scripture, and included the investigation of the manuscripts, and the different readings in the various versions and codices and manuscripts in order that we may be sure we have the original words as they were written by the Divinely inspired writers. (See Briggs, Hex., page 1). The term generally used now-a-days is Textual Criticism. If the phrase were used in the twentieth century sense, Beza, Erasmus, Bengel, Griesbach, Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorff, Scrivener, Westcott, and Hort would be called Lower Critics. But the term is not now-a-days used as a rule. The Higher Criticism, on the contrary, was employed to designate the study of the historic origins, the dates, and authorship of the various books of the Bible, and that great branch of study which in the technical language of modern theology is known as Introduction. It is a very valuable branch of Biblical science, and is of the highest importance as an auxiliary in the interpretation of the Word of God. By its researches floods of light may be thrown on the Scriptures.
                   <br />
                   <br />                    
                    The term Higher Criticism, then, means nothing more than the study of the literary structure of the various books of the Bible, and more especially of the Old Testament. Now this in itself is most laudable. It is indispensable. It is just such work as every minister or Sunday School teacher does when he takes up his <i>Peloubet's Notes</i>, or his Stalker's <i>St. Paul</i>, or Geikie's <i>Hours with the Bible</i>, to find out all he can with regard to the portion of the Bible he is studying; the author, the date, the circumstances, and purpose of its writing.
                    <br />
                    <br /> 
                    WHY IS HIGHER CRITICISM IDENTIFIED WITH UNBELIEF?

                    How is it, then, that the Higher Criticism has become identified in the popular mind with attacks upon the Bible and the supernatural character of the Holy Scriptures?
                        
                    The reason is this. No study perhaps requires so devout a spirit and so exalted a faith in the supernatural as the pursuit of the Higher Criticism. It demands at once the ability of the scholar, and the simplicity of the believing child of God. For without faith no one can explain the Holy Scriptures, and without scholarship no one can investigate historic origins.
                        
                    There is a Higher Criticism that is at once reverent in tone and scholarly in work. Hengstenberg, the German, and Horne, the Englishman, may be taken as examples. Perhaps the greatest work in English on the Higher Criticism is Horne's Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scripture. It is a work that is simply massive in its scholarship, and invaluable in its vast reach of information for the study of the Holy Scriptures. But Horne's Introduction is too large a work. It is too cumbrous for use in this hurrying age. (Carter's edition in two volumes contains 1,149 pages, and in ordinary book form would contain over 4,000 pages, i.e., about ten volumes of 400 pages each). Latterly, however, it has been edited by Dr. Samuel Davidson, who practically adopted the views of Hupfield and Halle and interpolated not a few of the modern German theories. But Horne's work from first to last is the work of a Christian believer; constructive, not destructive; fortifying faith in the Bible, not rationalistic. But the work of the Higher Critic has not always been pursued in a reverent spirit nor in the spirit of scientific and Christian scholarship.

            to combat the toleration of the false teachers in other apps and to
            bring forward suppressed Bible preachers with doctrinally sound
