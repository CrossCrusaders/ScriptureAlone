            <h1>R.A. Torrey</h1>
            <p>In the early 1900s many Christians found themselves fighting against the liberalism that was creeping into the church. This gave them a desire to set forth the fundamentals of the Christian faith. The task to compile such works defending the Scriptures was given first to A. C. Dixon, then to Louis Meyer, and then ultimately to R. A. Torrey (1856-1928). They compiled the works of many conservative writers and issued them in twelve volumes (later printed in a four-volume set). Included in their work are articles dealing with the fallacies of higher criticism, the inspiration and unity of Scripture, the archeological attestation of Scripture, the divinity of Christ and the Holy Spirit, justification by faith, personal testimonies and much more. This work became known as The Fundamentals. The importance of The Fundamentals was that it showed that there are very reasonable defenses to answer claims against Scripture. This is the unabridged edition which features ninety different articles by sixty-six authors.</p>
